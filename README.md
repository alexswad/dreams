# Welcome to DREAMS!
This project is for creating "maps within's maps", featuring a networked custom collision handler that works off of converted VMFs
### This is a very WIP project and many things are expected to be added/changed

To first get started with Dreams, either install the stable version from the [workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3430729756&searchtext=), or [download the latest development version from GitHub](https://github.com/alexswad/dreams/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the addon folder in your `GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons/` folder   

With Dreams installed, simply adding any lua file into `lua/includes/dreams` will be initialized with a DREAMS meta table  
See the [example](https://github.com/alexswad/dreams/blob/main/lua/includes/dreams/example.lua) or [DREAMS Wiki](https://alexswad.github.io/dreams-wiki/) for details.
